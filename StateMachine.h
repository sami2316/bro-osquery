/**
 * This class implements the simple state machine operation. Its main function
 * is to track local as well as remote (bro-side) events and then do the 
 * allowed operations if the event is received in allowed operation state. 
 * If event is illegal then error/warning message will be delivered to bro-side.
 * 
 * This class has been written in an effort to eliminate or minimize the 
 * sequential/ordered execution.
 * 
 * It consists of four allowed states:
 * 1- INIT: 
 *          This is the initializing state in which we need to read broker.ini.
 *          If the reading process is successful then it also establishes the 
 *          connection with the Bro Master.
 * 2- WAIT_FOR_TOPIC: 
 *          In this state, "group topic event" is the only legitmite event. 
 *          When "group topic event" is received then it starts listening 
 *          for broker::messages on the newly received topic.
 * 3- GET_AND_PROCESS_QUERIES:
 *        This state is responsible for queries subscription and un-subscription
 *        and it also sends query updates when TIMER_EVENT is received.
 * 4- TERMINATE:
 *          In this state, occupied resources are freed and gracefully exits 
 *          from the module.
 *          .
